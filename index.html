            <p>Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly 
                experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes,
                 one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal 
                 (known as the "standard route") 
                and the other from the north in Tibet. </p>

            <p>Mount Kenya is the highest mountain in Kenya and 
                the second-highest in Africa, after Kilimanjaro.
                The highest peaks of the mountain are Batian 
                (5,199 metres or 17,057 feet), Nelion (5,188 m or 17,021 ft) 
                and Point Lenana (4,985 m or 16,355 ft).

            <p>Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth. 
                It is part of Kilimanjaro National Park and is a major climbing destination. 
                Because of its shrinking glaciers and ice fields, which are projected 
                to disappear between 2030 and 2050, 
                it has been the subject of many scientific studies.</p>

           <P>Nairobi (/naɪˈroʊbi/) is the capital and the largest city of Kenya. 
               The name comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to "cool water", 
               a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. The city proper had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019 census, 
               while the metropolitan area has a population of 9,354,580.

              entrance to the 1889 World's Fair and was initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals 
              for its design,
